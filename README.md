# ML Models
In this project, I applied various machine learning models to determine which model achieves the highest accuracy. Additionally, I assessed multicollinearity among the variables using the #Variance #Inflation #Factor (VIF) to identify
which variables exhibit the highest multicollinearity. The analysis included building a #baseline model and, after removing variables with high #multicollinearity, developing a #final #model for improved accuracy and performance.
